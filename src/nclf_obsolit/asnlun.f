      SUBROUTINE ASNLUN (UNIT,DEVICE,TERMNO,IERR)
 
C ************************************************************************
C ************************************************************************
C           THIS SUBROUTINE IS FOR USE ON THE VAX VERSION ONLY.  IT
C           REPLACES THE CALL TO THE FORTRAN RUN TIME LIBRARY ASNLUN
C           MODULE THAT RSX11M HAS BUT VAX DOESN'T HAVE

      CHARACTER*1 ADEVIC(6),ACTERM(3)
      CHARACTER*3 CTERMN
      CHARACTER*6 DEVICE,CDEVIC
      EQUIVALENCE (ADEVIC,CDEVIC),(ACTERM,CTERMN)
 
C          DUMMY SUBROUTINE TO REPLACE ASNLUN FORTRAN CALL IN RXS
C
C      THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE IT LIKE ASNLUN ON RSX WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.
C      IT IS ALWAYS CALLED WITH THE COMPLETE DEVICE NAME IN ARG DEVICE
C      AND 0 IN TERMNO. THE SAME EFFECT COULD PROBABLY BE ACHIEVED BY
C      DOING A CLOSE AND AN OPEN USING DEVICE IN THE FILE SPEC.
 
      IERR=0
